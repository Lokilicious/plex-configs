## Kometa

What my config does:
- Set overlays for Language Flags, Resolution, HDR & a Low Quality banner for TELESYNCS
- Create Collections for Universe, Animation, Disney and some Actors
- Create Collections for Media which was previously only English but now also has a German release
- Create Collections for Media which was previously only a TELESYNC but has now a Web or Bluray release.
- Creates Collections for Media which is trending on Trakt and sends missing media to Radarr / Sonarr
- Fixes Plex Categories by syncing them from TMDB
- Updates Ratings by syncing them from Rotten Tomatoes and Trakt
